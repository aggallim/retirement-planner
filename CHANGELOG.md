# Changelog

All notable changes to the UK Retirement Planner, most recent first. Each
entry names the requirement it implements (`intent/NNN-slug.md` /
`spec/NNN-slug.md`, both moved to their `done/` directories once shipped).

This file is the short, chronological "what shipped when." For the
detailed narrative — why a calculation changed, what broke before it was
fixed — see `docs/TOOL_DOCUMENTATION.md` §8 Build history.

## 2026-09-16 — Extra savings accounts (002)

- Replaced each person's single blended ISA field with **Cash ISA**,
  **Stocks & Shares ISA** and **LISA** sub-accounts, plus a free-form,
  add/remove list of **other savings** accounts.
- **LISA bonus**: contributions get an automatic 25% government top-up.
- **LISA age-60 gate**: LISA balances can't fund a spending gap before 60,
  though they still accrue contributions, bonus and growth throughout.
- **Fixed drawdown order** — other savings → Cash ISA → S&S ISA → LISA —
  replacing the old single proportional ISA draw.
- **Allowance warnings** for combined ISA/LISA contributions over £20,000
  and LISA contributions over £4,000 (warning-only, not hard-capped).
- **Migration**: existing saved plans map their old single ISA balance onto
  the new Stocks & Shares ISA field rather than losing data.
- `docs/TOOL_DOCUMENTATION.md` and `test-engine.js` updated throughout.
- Implements `intent/done/002-extra-savings-accounts.md`.

## 2026-09-15 — Engine test harness (001)

- Added `tests/test-engine.js`, a dependency-free `node` script that
  extracts `projectJoint()` straight out of `index.html` (via
  `// ENGINE-EXTRACT-START` / `// ENGINE-EXTRACT-END` markers) and asserts
  the full `docs/TOOL_DOCUMENTATION.md` §5.4 verification checklist —
  lump-sum split, the 4% rule, mortgage payoff timing, State Pension
  timing, joint-mode reconciliation, depletion detection, and a
  byte-for-byte individual-mode regression baseline.
- Added `.github/workflows/test-engine.yml` to run it in CI on every push
  and PR, separate from the Pages deploy workflow.
- Implements `intent/done/001-engine-test-harness.md`.

## 2026-09-15 — Initial release

- Brought the UK Retirement Planner PWA into this repository (previously a
  standalone build) and deployed it to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
- Added `CLAUDE.md` project guidance and `docs/TOOL_DOCUMENTATION.md`.
